# iOS 8 Support
Support for iOS 8 device and simulator builds has been added to 6.6.4-rc-1 for OS 10.9 users. This means that if you are using OS 10.9 you must now have Xcode 6 installed in order to perform device builds. The requirements for all previous OS X versions will remain the same.

Bugs relating to orientation, push notifications and screen sizes on iOS 8 have been resolved in addition to standalone builder updates allowing for the specification of new iPhone 6 splash screens.
